# ShopNow-A-Responsive-E-commerce-Website
ShopNow is a fully functional, responsive e-commerce web application designed to replicate the experience of an online shopping platform. The project demonstrates the integration of core web development concepts using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, with a focus on user interactivity and modular design.

The platform allows users to explore a wide range of products, apply price filters, search for specific items, view detailed product information, manage a dynamic shopping cart, proceed to checkout, and receive a confirmation after purchase. All functionalities are implemented on the client side using vanilla JavaScript, and localStorage is used to store cart and order data across pages without the need for a backend or database.

The website consists of multiple interconnected pages:

Homepage: Highlights brand message and links to shop.

Product List Page: Displays all products with filtering functionality.

Product Details Page: Shows selected product info with an "Add to Cart" option.

Cart Page: Allows quantity adjustments, removal of items, and price calculation.

Checkout Page: Shows order summary and captures user confirmation.

Order Confirmation Page: Displays mock order number and status.

Search Page: Enables users to find products by name with a quick redirect.

Each page is designed for user-friendliness and accessibility across devices using responsive layouts. Users can interact with product cards, filter by price range, search items, and manage their cart efficiently. Navigation between pages is seamless, with shared product data being passed or retrieved using the browserâ€™s localStorage.

The project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of frontend web development skills and provides a strong foundation for integration with backend technologies in the future.

Technologies Used:
HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4

JavaScript (ES6)

LocalStorage for cart and order persistence

Responsive design and modular file structure
